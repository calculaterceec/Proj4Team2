## Project 4 - Team 2
 
**I. Problem Statement**

Using aggregated climate, demographic, and health data, identify meaningful drivers of health outcomes and create an interactive visualization of the data.

**II. Executive Summary**

Blah blah blah

**III. Scope Note**

For a given census tract (or other geo variable) between years x-y, there was an (insert variable) percent change in the daily temperature, and these were the demographics for that tract, and during that year range there was an increase/decrease in cases of (insert infectious disease thing or asthma or other climate-affected disease). This study is completely pre-COVID. 

**IV. Methodology**

Put that here.
    
**V. Conclusion and Path Forward**

What did we learn? What's next

**VI. Data**
